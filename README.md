This is a placeholder repo for an upcoming project: virtual user interface, or vui, an experimental kind of UI for VR. 

The basic idea extends from the fact that we after GUIs revolutionized the PC world, moving most people away from CLIs, we haven't really seen a new paradigm for UIs. VR headsets hint at this new kind of user interface, but we haven't moved them into mainstream computing and certainly not programming, as far as I know.

The specific goal I'm after here is making a kind of VUI that would enable "virtual programming" — a highly-abstracted, gesturally declarative kind of programming. 

Imagine you're a React programmer, and you're in a VUI wearing a VR headset. You "declare" a new component by "grabbing" two other composable components. You "render" it off to the side, and you slide a <Form /> element (as a visual representative of a form...) into the center of the screen you're working on. You don't have to explicitely define margins or anything because—like a VR extension of Steve's UI builder—you're abstracted away from leaf-level changes in a declarative framework.

So that's an example of one use case. 

It's basically a VR extension of a "UI builder" that goes beyond the leaf and into the branch-level composition of a UI.

That's one example of how a VUI could be used to build UIs more interactively and intuitively.
